Scout Clicker is a game about the scout from tf2.
You collect Scout Coins and buy things.
However the IRS is watching over your operation, 
if you get too much in debt then they will start taking money, and if you
have no money then they will reset your save.

-- Level One -- 

You can buy Lipton, Lipton increases the ammount of coins you can click.

You can buy generators:

Counterfit Scout Generator - This generates one scout per 3 seconds.
Cost: 145
Heavy - The Heavy generates 3 scouts every 2 seconds, mmm hard labour.
Cost: 300
Namebrand Scout Generator - The More premium Scout Generator, it generates 2 scouts every second.
Cost: 750
Yeti - Instead of a heavy generating it you get a yeti, the yeti is strong and can generate 
4 scounds in 1 second.
Cost: 2000

--Level Two -- 
At 50,000 Scout Coins you get to ascend to the next level. 
You ascend to the galaxy and become a statue, you also gain a bunch of new things. 

You gain new stats:
Defense
Attack
Dodge


The lipton gods give you a pet heavy, the pet heavy can be trained and fed. 

If you take care of him by feeding him and training him then he will give you benefits such as:
A random chance of recieving a bonus like, extra scout coins, extra scout mod, payoff debt.
He can increase your attack the more training you give him.

If he isn't level 50 then you can't take the requirments to ascend.

You also unlock Engies weapon shop.
Engie can give you weapons like:
Shotgun - ATK 10, COST: 20000
Super Sword - ATK 30, COST: 35000
Sentrys - ATK 5 per sentry, COST: 20000
Dispensers - DEF +5 per dispenser, COST: 25000
Ultra Rocket Launcher - ATK 100, COST: 150000

Health potion - increases health in fight, COST: 5000

All your generators reset and you get new generators:

Costs: 2000
Meteor - Generates 20 scouts in 0.5 seconds

Now why is there extra stats, because one of the requirments to ascend again is to takedown the IRS.
When you reach 100000 scout coins you can fight them:

IRS soldiers - The first enemy, HLTH: 1000, ATK: 5 every second
